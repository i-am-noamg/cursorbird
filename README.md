## 🎯 What is This?

- Tab to flap
- Open source
- Automatically opens when agents start; closes when all agents finish
- Uses Cursor Hooks to automatically detect agent lifecycle
- Workspace-specific best scores
- Much better than doomscrolling

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Installation

**From Cursor's Extension Search** (Recommended)
1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Extensions (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Cursor Bird"
4. Click Install
5. Restart Cursor

**Manual Installation**
1. Download the `.vsix` file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/i-am-noamg/cursorbird/releases/latest)
2. In Cursor, press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "Install from VSIX" → Select the file
3. Restart Cursor

**Note:** Add `.cursor/` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing status files.

### Usage

Once installed:
1. **Start an AI agent** – the game opens automatically in a paused state! 🎮
2. **Press Tab** to start playing (or configure a different key in settings)
3. The game closes automatically when your agent finishes

That's it! The extension automatically sets up everything you need.

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Node.js** must be installed and available in your PATH. Verify with `node --version`. If missing, the game won't auto-open (manual commands still work).

## Commands & Configuration

**Commands:**
- **Cursor Bird: Toggle** - Manually toggle the game
- **Cursor Bird: Start** - Manually start the game
- **Cursor Bird: Stop** - Manually stop the game
- **Cursor Bird: Reset Best Score** - Reset the best score for the current workspace
- **Cursor Bird: Setup Hooks** - Manually configure global Cursor Hooks (in `~/.cursor/hooks.json`)
- **Cursor Bird: Configure Game Settings** - Open extension settings

**Settings:** Customize physics, visuals, behavior, and controls via Cursor settings. Search for "Cursor Bird" in settings or use the command palette.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to set up hooks for each workspace?

No! The extension automatically configures global hooks during installation. They work across all workspaces automatically.

### What files does the extension create?

The extension creates temporary status files in `.cursor/` within your workspace. These are automatically cleaned up when you disable or uninstall the extension. Add `.cursor/` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing them.
